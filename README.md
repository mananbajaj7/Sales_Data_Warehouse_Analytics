# ðŸ§  Sales Data Warehouse Analytics

This project builds a lightweight sales data warehouse and delivers deep analysis on customer behavior and product performance using SQL. By transforming raw transactional data into dimensional insights, the project helps identify key revenue drivers and customer segments through advanced SQL techniques.

---

### ðŸ“Š Customer Behavior Analysis

The **customer report** aggregates and analyzes customer-level activity to uncover behavioral and financial patterns. Key features include:

* **Customer segmentation** into:

  * **VIP**: High-spending, long-term customers
  * **Regular**: Moderate-spending, long-term customers
  * **New**: Recently acquired or short-term customers
* **Age-based grouping** (e.g., Under 20, 20â€“29, 30â€“39, etc.)
* Metrics calculated:

  * Total orders, products purchased, and quantity
  * Total lifetime sales
  * Customer lifespan (months active)
  * Recency (months since last purchase)
  * **Average Order Value (AOV)**
  * **Average Monthly Spend**

---

### ðŸ“¦ Product Performance Analysis

The **product report** tracks performance across product lines to identify top and underperforming items. It includes:

* **Product segmentation** based on revenue:

  * **High-Performer**: Top-revenue drivers
  * **Mid-Range**: Consistently selling products
  * **Low-Performer**: Minimal contribution to revenue
* Metrics calculated:

  * Total sales, quantity sold, and unique customers
  * Product lifespan (months between first and last sale)
  * Recency of last sale
  * **Average Selling Price**
  * **Average Order Revenue**
  * **Average Monthly Revenue**

### ðŸ§  Analytical Techniques Used

* Window functions:

  * `SUM() OVER` for running totals
  * `AVG() OVER` for moving averages
  * `LAG()` for year-over-year or month-over-month comparisons
* Date-based calculations:

  * Lifespan and recency in months
  * Year and month grouping for trend analysis
* Dimensional modeling:

  * Star schema with `fact_sales`, `dim_customers`, and `dim_products`
* Segmentation logic using `CASE` statements for clear, business-driven grouping

---

### ðŸ“ˆ Business Impact Simulated

* Identifies customer groups with the highest lifetime value
* Highlights underperforming products to inform inventory and marketing strategy
* Surfaces trends in customer loyalty and product lifecycle
* Supports revenue forecasting through time-based behavior metrics

---

### ðŸ›  Skills Demonstrated

* Advanced SQL analytics
* Dimensional data modeling
* Behavioral segmentation and cohort analysis
* Revenue performance evaluation
* Time-series analysis using native SQL
